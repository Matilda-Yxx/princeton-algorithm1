This algorithms course is one of the most popular computer science courses on MOOC platforms. The course contents are superb, so does the assignments (their autograders are awesome!). However, since this course uses Java, I would recommend those without any Java background to take the preliminary course taught by the same instructor (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java/home/welcome).

Solutions in this repository are wriiten by me. Some of the solutions have not obtained 100/100 full marks, but they definitely pass the 80/100 bar. As a newbie to Java, I'm not aiming for full marks yet. 

This repository is mainly for progress tracking purposes.
